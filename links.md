## Virtualization
- [What is Virtualization?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtualization-a-complete-guide)<br>
Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer 
hardware that allows that computer's hardware elements to be divided into 
multiple virtual computers or virtual machines. This allows for more 
efficient utilization of physical computer hardware and its resources.

- [Belajar Memakai GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG/GPG)](https://medium.com/kode-dan-kodean/belajar-memakai-gnu-privacy-guard-gnupg-gpg-3944e19dba91)<br>
GPG is an application that lets you encrypt, decrypt, and sign a digital data for exchanging data.
It's a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standardas defined by RFC4880(PGP).
GPG is an excellent method to ensure secure communication between two parties, which allows sensitive information 
to be easily shared across an insecure network. Here i present to you a useful article that i read to learn about GPG.
- [Is GPG Still Useful in Todays Insecure World?](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/is-gpg-still-useful-in-todays-insecure-world/)<br>>
The main reason that encryption still exists and is widely used today is to protect user's communications, data , and 
privacy. Moreover, with today's ongoing security breaches, 0-day vulnerabilities, malicious exploit attempts, and 
password being sold on the dark web, makes your security more important than ever. More on that, read this article!

# Memory Management
- [Memory Management in OS: Contiguous, Swapping, Fragmentation](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html)<br>
What is memory management? why do we use it? what are the techniques on how memory being managed? How do data being 
allocated in our memory? This website gives you full on explanation about memory management. Make sure to check it 
out!
- [Paging in Operating System - Memory Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ6qrCB8pDw&ab_channel=SimpleSnippets)<br>
When multitasking comes to picture, your Random Access Memory (RAM) or your primary memory will be full of running 
application. Especially whem doing complex, heavy task such as gaming and graphic intensive application, it will 
take up more RAM and processing so your computer will need to manage your memory. This video explained how and why 
paging is one of the method in which you can manage your memory efficiently.
- [What is Address Binding?](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-address-binding)<br>

- [A Comparison of Three Page Replacement Algorithms](https://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/ajis/article/download/7405/7089#:~:text=LRU%20resulted%20to%20be%20the,is%20placed%20at%20the%20rear.)<br>
Over the years, a lot of algorithm have been developed to find the best and fastest way to execute the page replacement 
process in a computer memory. The First-In-First-Out, Least Frequently Used, and Optimal Algorithm are Three of many 
known algorithm to this date. But which one is the fastest and have the most efficient performance if we compare them? 
you can read this journal if you're curious!
- [What is Thrash?](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-thrash#:~:text=Thrashing%20is%20when%20the%20page,to%20be%20reduced%20or%20negligible.)<br>
When a process accesses a memory page without proper preparations or when it access data or code in its space address 
but is not currently located in the system RAM, a page fault occurs. When a page fault happens, the OS will try to 
fetch that page from secondary memory and try to swap it with one of the pages in RAM. This process is called swapping. 
When the page fault and swapping happens very frequently at a high rate, the OS needs to spend more time swaping these 
pages. Are you curious what this state is all about? just click the article above!

# Process and Threads
- [Process vs Thread by Udacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhf-DYO1K78&ab_channel=Udacity)<br>
Diving into the operating system world, we surely will encounter terms such as process and threads. Check out this 
video to differentiate between these two terms! OR you could watch this [other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EyzlZxx3g&ab_channel=Udacity) 
if you need an explanation in simpler analogy. Both of those videos were made by Udacity!
- [Fork() in C Programming Language](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/fork-in-c-programming-language/)<br>
The fork() function is the primary method of process creation on Unix-like operation. This function creates a copy 
called a *child* out of the original process, which is called the *parent*. Note that the fork() function only works 
on Linux or Unix based operating system. You should check out this article for more interesting info about fork!
- [Operating System Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>
In some CPU, only 1 process is allowed to run at a time. So how are those processes can be run by the CPU sequentially? 
The Process Scheduler comes for to the rescue! It schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on 
particular scheduling algorithms. Hmm, i wonder what kind of algorithm it used...

# Process Synchronization
- [Process Synchronization - Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKKc0d7kzww&ab_channel=in5minutes)<br>
In Operating System, it is often that multiple process tried to access the same data in a shared memory. So, we need 
someway to coordinate those accesses with synchronization. This 5 minute video should be useful for those of you 
lazy people to understand the basic of this problem!
- [Deadlock, Livelock, and Starvation](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/deadlock-livelock-starvation)<br>
Many times in Operating System, more than one process may compete for a finite set of resources. Usually if a process 
requests for a resource and it's not available, then the process waits for it. But, there are three scenarios where 
this waiting process never succeds, which is *deadlock*, *livelock*, and *starvation*. More info on these scenarios 
can be read in this useful article!
